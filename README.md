# Burger - Node Express Handlebars

This is a burger logger application with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). It follows the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

## Contents

The project is composed of readme, package.json, schema.sql, seed.sql and license files.

## User Story

As a business owner
I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
So that I can organize and plan my business
​

## Acceptance Criteria

* Functional application.
* The command-line application should allow users to:

  * Add departments, roles, employees

  * View departments, roles, employees

  * Update employee roles

### Instalation

* Use the [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.

* Use [InquirerJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3) NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

* Use [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of `console.table`, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.

## Built With

- [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - The editor of choice
- [Terminal](https://gitforwindows.org/) - What would we do without our bash?
